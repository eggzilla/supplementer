The gene MAP3K7 is moderatly expressed in human and bat datasets. However it seems to be downregulated in bat over time, which can be seen by a 2-fold expression level decrease.
    The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase mediates
    the signaling transduction induced by TGF beta and morphogenetic protein (BMP), and controls a variety of cell
    functions including transcription regulation and apoptosis. In response to IL-1, this protein forms a kinase
    complex including TRAF6, MAP3K7P1/TAB1 and MAP3K7P2/TAB2; this complex is required for the activation of nuclear
    factor kappa B. This kinase can also activate MAPK8/JNK, MAP2K4/MKK4, and thus plays a role in the cell response
    to environmental stresses. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been
    reported. (provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008)
